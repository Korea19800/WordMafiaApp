How to play this game:

0. First of all, this app

a. It's not a game you can play alone. You need at least four people to play

b. This is not an online game. It's a game that replaces the host.

c. It's a game where each participant has to take turns to play the game.

d. What is a mafia game?

Mafia game is a game in which the mafia kills citizens at night and citizens kill the mafia by voting in the morning.
If there are 0 mafias, citizens will win!
If the number of mafias is no less than the number of citizens, the mafia wins!

e. What is the Word mafia game?

The difference between the word mafia and mafia game comes out in the morning. In a mafia game, you kill a person in the morning by a vote.
However, there is no clue to guess who the mafia is.

On the other hand, the word mafia is different. The host of the game shows different keywords to citizens and mafias individually(you cannot look at another person’s word). 
After the host shows the keyword to all players, each player has to say a word related to the key word.(If a player says the same given keyword, the player will be regarded as a mafia.) Since the mafia does not know the keywords of citizens, the mafia has to guess keywords based on other people’s remarks during the day. If a person says something not related to the keyword, citizens will suspect the person as a mafia. 
Therefore, citizens can guess who the mafia is by their remarks during the day.
